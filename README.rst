Python Serverless Microframework for AWS (Runtime)
==================================================

Chalice is a microframework for writing serverless apps in python. It allows
you to quickly create and deploy applications that use AWS Lambda.  It provides:

* A command line tool for creating, deploying, and managing your app
* A decorator based API for integrating with Amazon API Gateway, Amazon S3,
  Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, and other AWS services.
* Automatic IAM policy generation

This is the small slice of the upstream chalice repository that contains
just the part that is used at Lambda runtime.
